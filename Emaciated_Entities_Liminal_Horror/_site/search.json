    "text": "The Toll of Unmeaning\n\nPlease read this poem of flosculations, Upon this kalotypography. Experience apanthropinization, To inhabit its lost artigraphy.\nDisplaced through summotion, It pealed against eveniance. Taken by tollation, Transported in a grand gardeviance.\nNow its voice no different to crocitations, Never completing its archiloquy. For to all that hear its blaterations, They will always be deaf to its tortiloquy.\nYet, its form interests the campanologists, And they toll the bell to desarcinate. So they turn into phlyarologists, And all at once are unable to obacerate.\nIts echoed pain only brings it amarulence, So they’re silenced with a guillotining. Its voice is long dead, ringing in a graviloquence, And so the bell chimes, the Toll of unmeaning.",

Money and self worth is the bait, All that leads is to a skeleton bare.\nIt once guarded those with spermaceti, But humans hunted them for candles. Now it eats them like spaghetti, Humans using its teeth as handles.\nTwo wicks at both ends of our bones, Flickering pink the vigour of man. We are forced to repay our grisly loans, To the whale, to the Biter of Hands.",

Now your trunk is rough like bark, Traced over with lichtenburg figures.\nAcross your skin branching like a tree, Disguised as an arboreal tattoo. You know it is a key, To a power that glows Electric blue.\nWhen it courses through you with voltage, It’ll bequeath you a mighty strength. Burning through your body in rage, To pay you’ll go to any length.\nA fallen tree with cracks aflame, Those it touches become like kings. Shining bright but ultimately put to shame, For it’ll burn within you, The Lighter of Kindling.",

Choose one of your ability scores, roll d4 and add it to the score (max 18).\nGoosed: Goose feathers sprout from your body, plucking them is painful. You are an intimidating presence whilst amongst allies. Once during each round of combat you can remove one dice, after rolling, from an enemy who attacked an ally. When you are alone with no allies your HP is 0.\nFingerprint ink: Thick ink exudes from your fingertips. It stops once it covers your prints but is excreted once more when removed through cleaning or use of the ink. Once a mystery predict the future or rewrite the past, doing so comes at a cost.\nChromatophores: Invisible ethereal chromatophores surround your body (clothing included). With deep focus you can make these visible and control their colour, able to be used as camouflage and possible other uses.\nExpressive writing: You are constantly narrating events as they occur to you, whether on paper, out loud, or in your mind. This allows you to always self-distance yourself. +1 Stability.\nRumpelstiltskin: Write down the true full name of a person or entity. The name is expunged from all realities except from the mind of its owner. Choose one of three effects: (1) the person/entity is bound to the current place they are in, (2) the person’s/entity’s nature is known to you (show the player its stat block), or (3) the person/entity suffers d12 CTRL damage.",
