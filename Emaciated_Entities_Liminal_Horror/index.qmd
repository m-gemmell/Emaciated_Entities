title: "Emaciated Entities"
---

The Emaciated Entities were once powerful beings, now starved by the machinations of mankind. They prey on humans who deny these entities’ their previous purpose.

Little is known about them. The most concrete information is contained within the following six poems. Their authors were never discovered. Each poem was scribed on a different type of writing medium (the back of a painting, lightning struck bark, etc.), with unique lettering substances (cephalopod ink, pink wax, etc). Their credibility has been validated due to their presence at sites designated as EALs (Entity Affected Location). Further research is advised to determine their true quantity and influence.

## Purpose of this website

This is a website to host information on the Sticky Crawl and 6 Emaciated Entities.
These materials are compatible with the [Liminal Horror TTRPG](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/).

__Note:__ This site is a work in progress with much to add and edit.

## Sticky crawl

[The Sticky Crawl](/sticky_crawl/sticky_crawl.qmd) is a method to create mystery locations with the following features:

- Locations are represented by sticky notes with 1-4 exits (matching the sticky note sides).
- The layout of the location is organic with random sticky notes being placed as the investigators use exits.
- The locations are not random, instead the "pool" of locations are bespoke to the mystery.

On top of the rules a small example Sticky Crawl is included.
