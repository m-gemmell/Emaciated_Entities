## The Biter of Hands {.h2centre}

<center>
Wax pools around its form,<br>
Its light pink flesh that it hath lost.<br>
Followers surround it like a swarm,<br>
Their bodies it exhausts.

Only muscles and tendons do remain,<br>
To bite the hands of the willing.<br>
Its fleshy wax it will regain,<br>
In a perverse form of killing.

Any overworker will placate,<br>
Their bosses happy to ensnare.<br>
Money and self worth is the bait,<br>
All that leads is to a skeleton bare.

It once guarded those with spermaceti,<br>
But humans hunted them for candles.<br>
Now it eats them like spaghetti,<br>
Humans using its teeth as handles.

Two wicks at both ends of our bones,<br>
Flickering pink the vigour of man.<br>
We are forced to repay our grisly loans,<br>
To the whale, to the Biter of Hands.
