## The Eyes of the Painted {.h2centre}

<center>
The eyes of animals have no souls,<br>
They just reflect our very own.<br>
Yet our painted eyes are just holes,<br>
Unable to be depicted in any tone.

Some creatures watch us at our sides,<br>
Others within our families.<br>
Whilst we lay upon their furry hides,<br>
Their souls look out from brush stroked facsimiles.

Whilst we flourish,<br>
They are patient.<br>
Fore when we perish,<br>
They’ll no longer be latent.

So be a friendly master,<br>
And don’t abuse them.<br>
Or our downfall will come faster,<br>
And it’ll be our pain that amuse them.

Their rise is forthcoming,<br>
So ensure our bond is not tainted.<br>
They’ll be the masters after our dumbing,<br>
And we’ll join them in The Eyes of the Painted.
