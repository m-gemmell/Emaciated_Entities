## The Lighter of Kindling {.h2centre}

<center>
With your physique you stand tall and proud,<br>
Your muscles gleaming and glistening.<br>
But it's always the largest to be struck down,<br>
By that force of nature, lightning.

Red lines, stretch marks,<br>
Appear as your body reconfigures.<br>
Now your trunk is rough like bark,<br>
Traced over with lichtenburg figures.

Across your skin branching like a tree,<br>
Disguised as an arboreal tattoo.<br>
You know it is a key,<br>
To a power that glows Electric blue.

When it courses through you with voltage,<br>
It'll bequeath you a mighty strength.<br>
Burning through your body in rage,<br>
To pay you’ll go to any length.

A fallen tree with cracks aflame,<br>
Those it touches become like kings.<br>
Shining bright but ultimately put to shame,<br>
For it'll burn within you, The Lighter of Kindling.
