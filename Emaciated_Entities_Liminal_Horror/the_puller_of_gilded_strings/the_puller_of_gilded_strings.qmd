## The Puller of Gilded Strings {.h2centre}

<center>
Tongue of manipulation,<br>
Teeth of gold.<br>
You set the stipulations,<br>
Or at least that’s what you’re told.

Moth to the fire,<br>
Conned to impoverished.<br>
Success to the liar,<br>
With precious metals untarnished.

Though you’re not of their ilk,<br>
The rich accept your disguise.<br>
With money, metal, silk,<br>
You’ll escape to the skies.

It all twists as a coil,<br>
A glittering cocoon.<br>
But within it you will boil,<br>
Under the light of the full moon.

So it’ll take its thread,<br>
To weave its wings.<br>
Seems you were the one led,<br>
By The Puller of Gilded Strings.
