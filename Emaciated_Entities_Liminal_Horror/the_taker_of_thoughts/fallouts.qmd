# Fallouts

Below is a D6 list of Fallouts to be used for the mystery [Shred after writing](/the_taker_of_thoughts/mystery_intro.qmd) or when forces of "The Taker of Thoughts" are encountered in other sessions/mysteries.

If a fallout is rolled that another character has previously gained then reroll on the table.
If the reroll is yet again a fallout another character has previously gained roll for a random [Legacy fallout](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/investigators/#legacy-fallout) instead.

## Text version

1. __Dissociative fugue:__ You are not the person you thought you were. Choose a new name, reroll your background, and reroll all optional investigator details you have. Choose one of your ability scores, roll d4 and add it to the score (max 18).
2. __Goosed:__ Goose feathers sprout from your body, plucking them is painful. You are an intimidating presence whilst amongst allies. Once during each round of combat you can remove one dice, after rolling, from an enemy who attacked an ally. When you are alone with no allies your HP is 0.
3. __Fingerprints:__ Thick ink exudes from your fingertips. The excretions stop whilst a film of ink covers the fingertips, like a slug's slime. Once a session write exactly 10 words with the ink to predict the future or rewrite the past, doing so comes at a cost.
4. __Chromatophores:__ Ethereal chromatophores surround your body and worn items. Normally transparent, with deep focus you can control their colour and opacity.
5. __Expressive writing:__ You are constantly narrating events as they occur to you, whether on paper, out loud, or in your mind. This allows you to always self-distance yourself. +1 Stability.
6. __Nikstlitslepmur:__ Names have power. Say the true name of an entity to summon it, your next attack against it is enhanced. Say the true name of an entity backwards to temporarily banish it, its next attack against you is impaired. After either you can never use its name again and it knows what you did.
