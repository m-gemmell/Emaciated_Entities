[Foie gras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras) is liver of a duck or goose that has been fattened by force feeding (gavage).
It is considered a delicacy of french cuisine.

## Start

> The whirring and vibration of a propeller engine on your back whilst your face braces against the wind.
> Gentle honks can be heard over the engine as geese fly in formation behind you.
> You watch the sun rising over the serene clouds knowing you are in for a long day.

The investigators are flying ultralight aircrafts to guide Geese during their migration. 

Ask each investigator how they intend to lead the geese through this long and cold flight successfully.
Each failed investigator suffers d4 stress.

Whether through failure or success the investigators are able to leave the room.

## Middle

> Echoes upon echoes of geese honks as an uncomfortable heat clings onto your crouched form.
> In one hand holds a nozzle attached to a fat and corn caked machine.
> Held by the other, the neck of a goose pinned to the ground between your legs.

The investigators are farm staff that force feed geese (gavage) to produce foie gras.
Other staff are present, demonstrating how to utilise their tools. 

D3 [Self-inserts](/the_taker_of_thoughts/literary_beings.qmd#self-insert) in the form of supervisors are present.
They will encourage any investigators unwilling to force feed their geese.
If that does not work they will punish the investigator instead.

The investigators can leave the room by leaving the farm.
Either through a day's labour, escape, or revolt.

## End

> The scent of fermented grapes, leather, and truffle as red wine is poured.
> The gentle steps of high-class wait staff is barely audible over the melody of polite conversations.
> Looking around you see the candlelit visages of your companions around your table.
> With a sudden flourish the [cloche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloche_(tableware)) before you ascends, revealing a buttery foi gras atop a hawthorn sauce flanked by gold flecked rose petals.

The investigators are sitting down for a meal at a very expensive french restaurant.
Those who partake of the foi gras gain +1 max HP (can only benefit once).

All the restaurant staff and other diners are [Self-inserts](/the_taker_of_thoughts/literary_beings.qmd#self-insert).
Some diners have their heads covered in large napkins eating [Ortolans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortolan_bunting) whole.

The investigators can leave at any time.
If they return they have another opportunity to eat the foi gras.

If any investigator partakes of the Foie gras [The Taker of Thoughts](/the_taker_of_thoughts/literary_beings.qmd#the-taker-of-thoughts) regains its feathers.
