# Short stories

There are 6 short story rooms.
Each is only encountered three times, telling a short story.
E.M. Gemovich is a staunch supporter of animal rights and so these stories tell a story of animal cruelty as a beginning, middle, and end.

When a short story room is first encountered it will take the form of the "start" for the current run.
The next run it is encountered it will take its "middle" form, and the next run it will its "end" form.
The short story room is then removed from the pool after the run.
The letters "S M E" are at the bottom of the sticky note for these rooms to track this progression.

Generally the short stories are split like so:

- __Start:__ 

All the non-investigator humans in the Short story rooms are [Self-inserts](/the_taker_of_thoughts/literary_beings.qmd#self-insert).
They all have the face of E.M. Gemovich and the only word they can say is "Gemovich".

A short story room remains as it was left during the same run, meaning benefits cannot be gained a second time be re-entering the room.
Generally, the investigators can freely pass through these rooms unless [The Taker of Thoughts](/the_taker_of_thoughts/literary_beings.qmd#the-taker-of-thoughts) is pursuing them.
In that case they can use the room to fight or they need some method to flee.
