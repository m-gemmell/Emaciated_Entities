## The Taker of Thoughts {.h2centre}

<center>
Grab its white feather,<br>
Write with its thick ink.<br>
Surrender your words till you're not but leather,<br>
Then with empty brain you can let your head sink.

Lay it atop a down pillow,<br>
And descend to the abyss.<br>
Every thought weighs a kilo,<br>
so write them down as a list.

Body of a plucked goose,<br>
Head of a dried squid.<br>
Our success is just a ruse,<br>
For it'll win with its black liquid.

For to enchant others the payment’s your mind,<br>
To be replaced with its inkened blots.<br>
So be content with your fate assigned,<br>
Decided upon by the taker of thoughts.

Who wrote this poem?<br>
It's in my hand.<br>
Did it come from my dome?<br>
I don't understand.
