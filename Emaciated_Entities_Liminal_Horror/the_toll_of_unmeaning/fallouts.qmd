Below is a D6 list of Fallouts to be used for this mystery or when forces of "The Toll of Unmeaning" are encountered.

1. Town crier: You can yell a cacophony of noise dealing d6 damage in a 15ft cone in front of you.
2. Pig latin: Your tongues twists, transfiguring to that of a pig's. Whilst talking you can decide who does and does not understand your speech. Roll 3d6, ff the total is higher than your current max STR, take the new result.
3. Tower bell: Your heart takes on the form and noise of a deep bell. The warm sound helps keep outer forces from encroaching into your body. Gain 1d4 max CTRL.
