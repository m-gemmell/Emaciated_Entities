# Locations

This page contains the locations for this mystery's [Sticky Crawl](/sticky_crawl/sticky_crawl.qmd).

## The bell tolls for thee

The bell rings out every 7 movements, i.e. any time the investigations move from one location to another. All humans in the gardens (the investigators and Issy) can hear this and suffer stress. The first ring is 1 stress and the next are +1 stress of the previous ring (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).

## Starting location

To start the mystery Issy brings the investigators to the "The Old Bell" location. She will answer questions but remain at The Old Bell.

### The Old Bell

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ![](images/bell.png){width="500"} | An old metal bell hangs off a tree with a thick rusted chain. Below the bell are seven concentric rings like ripples in the dirt. 6 sets of footprint leading away from the bell scar the once perfect circles. |
|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                   | -   The bell is a striking bell, it has no clapper and must be struck with an external instrument. Stirking it lets out a reverberating gong.                                                                   |
|                                   | -   Striking the bell causes 2 effects:                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                                   |     -   Those who strike the bell suffer 1 stress per ring.                                                                                                                                                     |
|                                   |     -   The striker chooses a location (sticky note) without any investigators (if any). This location is removed and added back to the random pool.                                                            |
|                                   | -   [The Bell Ritual](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_bell_ritual.qmd) must be accomplished here.                                                                                                                    |
|                                   | -   [Rotary Phone Head](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_guillotined.qmd#rotary-phone-head) will not hunt here                                                                                                        |

## East and West locations

In this mystery there are East and West locations.

The investigators will start by investigating the [East locations]. Once they have discovered all the [East locations] they will discover the [Gilbury Bridge] that leads to the [West locations].

The exits of [East locations] cannot be used to move directly to [West locations] or vice versa.

When investigators try to use an exit and there are no valid locations left in the pool, or the connection is invalid (i.e. an [East location](#east-locations) to a [West location](#west-locations)) they do not move normally. Instead, the Investigators move to a random valid location with an empty exit and they each suffer one stress. The 2 exits become connected.

## East locations

The 10 east locations are included within the sticky pool at the start of this sticky crawl.

The focus of this mystery in on the investigator's interactions with [The Guillotined](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_guillotined.qmd). Therefore, the descriptions of the locations are deliberately sparse. The facilitator is free to expand these in prep or during play.

East locations cannot directly connect to [West locations]. The East and West are only connected by [Gilbury Bridge].

### (1) Heather Gardens

+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ![](images/heather_garden.png){width="500"} | The smell of heather envelopes the area giving a homely vibe.                                                             |

### (3) Iris Garden

+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                          | -   Slowly the irses will turn to follow the investigators.                                                                         |

|                                          |     -   Those who failed will have their vision reversed. Their iris will look into their eye instead of outwards (1d4 dex damage). |
|                                          |     -   Vision will mostly return to normal once they leave the iris garden.                                                        |

### Massive Billy Goat Gruff

**STR**: 14 **DEX**: 14 **CTRL**: 10<br> **HP**: 6

Ram (d8)

-   A massive talking goat
-   Guards a bridge requiring a toll to pass
-   Although it will not let anyone pass without the toll it is surprisingly helpful

## West locations

The train line goes through this area. The train is constantly on the move, only briefly stopping at central station. Only glimpses of the train can be seen through the steam its constantly blowing whistle emits.

The 10 west locations can only be accessed through the [Gilbury Bridge] location and other West locations. East locations cannot directly connect to West locations.

### (1) Augustinii corner

|                                         | -   It is difficult to find [Steam Whistle Head](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_guillotined.qmd#steam-whistle-head) as their whistle echoes in the mist and the poor visibility makes navigating the bog dangerous. |

+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                           | -   It will not chew, instead only swallowing.                                                                                         |
|                                           | -   Soon the unlucky morsel will fall out the bottom of the treant suffering d6 damage and the treant will be satisfied momentarily.   |

|                                            | -   Whilst driving the train, the investigator can make it stop at any West location. The train restarts once investigators have jumped off. |
