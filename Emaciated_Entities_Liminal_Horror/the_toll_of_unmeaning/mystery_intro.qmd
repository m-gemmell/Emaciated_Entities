# Intro

Something terrible has occurred at Oxbury Gardens, a British garden attraction in the New Forest (South English coast).
The groundskeeper, Issy (she/her) (Issabella), has recruited the investigators to help. 
She let six individuals enter the gardens after dark.
They came to study the old bell, but something went wrong.

After leaving the six, Issy heard an immense ringing that rattled her soul.
She found no one at the bell and she has an itch at her neck she can't get rid of.
Not wanting to phone the cops because she shouldn't let people in after dark, especially for money she pockets herself, she contacts one of the investigators she knows.

Once the investigators have arrived at the [Old Bell](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/locations.qmd#the-old-bell) they wil not be able to escape the gardens until they have completed [The Bell Ritual](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_bell_ritual.qmd).
To complete the ritual they must find [The Guillotined](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_guillotined.qmd) and help them communicate to get the ritual steps.
