# The Guillotined

Each of The Guillotined wants to speak but they have been made undecipherable via their transformation.

The investigators need to help each of The Guillotined communicate to gather the different steps of [The Ritual](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/the_bell_ritual.qmd) to appease The Bell. 
Suggestions of solutions are included in each stat block but of course other suitable solutions the players think of can and should work. 
Once the investigators have received The Ritual Step The Guillotined will become undecipherable once more.

If one of The Guillotined dies their "head" will fall off and the investigators can use it to try to decipher the ritual step. Each head knows a different ritual step.

For more information on who The Guillotined were please see the [connections page](/the_toll_of_unmeaning/connections.qmd).
